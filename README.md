# ü™ù CoW Hooks dApps

A collaborative project between Bleu and CoW Protocol teams to enhance CoW Swap with customizable pre and post-swap actions.

## üéØ Introduction

CoW Hooks dApps is a collection of applications that integrate with CoW Swap's new hooks feature, allowing users to perform additional actions before or after token swaps. This monorepo contains implementations for various hooks that extend CoW Swap's functionality, making complex DeFi operations more streamlined and efficient.

## üî• Hooks dApps

Currently implemented hooks:

- **Claim Vesting Pre-Hook**: Claim LlamaPay vested tokens before swapping
- **Create Vesting Post-Hook**: Set up new LlamaPay vesting contracts after swapping
- **Withdraw Pool Pre-Hook**: Withdraw liquidity from CoW AMM before swapping
- **Deposit Pool Post-Hook**: Deposit tokens into CoW AMM after swapping

## üõ† Project Structure

This is a monorepo using pnpm for package management. Each hook is implemented as a separate application:

```
apps/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ claim-vesting/      # Vesting claim hook
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ create-vesting/     # Vesting creation hook
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ withdraw-pool/      # Pool withdrawal hook
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deposit-pool/       # Pool deposit hook
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- pnpm
- A Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bleu/cow-hooks-dapps
cd cow-hooks-dapps

# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

### Running a Hook Locally

1. Navigate to the specific hook app:

```bash
cd apps/<hook-app-name>
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

3. Connect your hook to CoW Swap:

   - Visit [dev.swap.cow.fi](https://dev.swap.cow.fi/#/100/swap/hooks)
   - Connect your wallet to a supported network
   - Click "Add Pre-Hook Action" or "Add Post-Hook Action"
   - Select "My Custom Hooks"
   - Click "Add custom hook"
   - Enter `http://127.0.0.1:3000` as the hook URL
   - Click "Add"

4. Your hook is now ready to use in the swap interface!

## üîß Development

### Linting

```bash
pnpm check
```

### Building

```bash
pnpm build
```

## üõ† Creating Your Own Hook dApp

Want to create your own hook? Follow these steps to add a new hook dApp to the monorepo:

1. Create a new project in the apps directory:

```bash
cd apps
mkdir my-custom-hook
cd my-custom-hook
```

2. Copy the basic package.json structure from one of the existing apps, making sure to update name, description and version.

3. Feel free to reuse any components from the packages workspace.

4. Implement your hook logic (remember providing a manifest.json in the app public folder with the hook informations).

5. Deploy your hook:

- You can deploy to any platform of your choice (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, etc.)
- Test your deployed hook by adding it to CoW Swap using the deployed URL

The library used to integrate CoW Swap with the hooks dApps is [@cowprotocol/hook-dapp-lib](https://github.com/cowprotocol/cowswap/blob/develop/libs/hook-dapp-lib/README.md). You can check its usage in this repo apps as examples.

## üìö Documentation

For more detailed information about each hook and how to use them, please refer to:

- [CoW Swap Documentation](https://docs.cow.fi)
- [Hooks Guide](https://docs.cow.fi/cow-protocol/reference/core/intents/hooks#creating-orders-with-hooks)

## Chain Integration Guide

This guide outlines the steps required to add support for a new chain in our repository in the case where the CoWSwap wants to deploy into a new chain.

### 1. Protocol Deployment Verification

First, verify that all required protocols are deployed on the target chain:

- [ ] LlamaPay
- [ ] Balancer
- [ ] CoW AMM
- [ ] Uniswap V2

You can verify deployments by checking each protocol's documentation or blockchain explorer.

### 2. Update Configuration Files

Search for all files marked with the `#CHAIN-INTEGRATION` tag and update them accordingly. This typically includes:

- Network configuration
- Token lists
- Protocol addresses

Don't forget to update all relevant `manifest.json` files across the applications.

### 3. Testing Process

Conduct manual testing using the CoWSwap interface:

1. Compare with existing chain implementation (e.g., if adding Polygon, compare with Gnosis Chain)
2. Test each application individually:
   - LlamaPay: Test stream creation and withdrawal
   - Balancer: Verify pool interactions
   - CoW AMM: Test liquidity provision and trading
   - Uniswap V2: Verify swap functionality

Document any chain-specific behaviors or issues encountered.

### 4. CoWSwap Integration

Once testing is complete and everything works as expected:

1. Open a Pull Request to the CoWSwap repository
2. Update the hook dapps registry at:
   ```
   https://github.com/cowprotocol/cowswap/blob/4b9331cbfab92fc113043c4e204e280b55d09f62/libs/hook-dapp-lib/src/hookDappsRegistry.json
   ```
3. Include test results and any chain-specific considerations in the PR description
