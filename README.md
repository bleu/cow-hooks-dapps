# ü™ù CoW Hooks dApps

A collaborative project between Bleu and CoW Protocol teams to enhance CoW Swap with customizable pre and post-swap actions.

## üéØ Introduction

CoW Hooks dApps is a collection of applications that integrate with CoW Swap's new hooks feature, allowing users to perform additional actions before or after token swaps. This monorepo contains implementations for various hooks that extend CoW Swap's functionality, making complex DeFi operations more streamlined and efficient.

## üî• Hooks dApps

Currently implemented hooks:

- **Claim Vesting Pre-Hook**: Claim LlamaPay vested tokens before swapping
- **Create Vesting Post-Hook**: Set up new LlamaPay vesting contracts after swapping
- **Withdraw Pool Pre-Hook**: Withdraw liquidity from CoW AMM before swapping
- **Deposit Pool Post-Hook**: Deposit tokens into CoW AMM after swapping

## üõ† Project Structure

This is a monorepo using pnpm for package management. Each hook is implemented as a separate application:

```
apps/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ claim-vesting/      # Vesting claim hook
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ create-vesting/     # Vesting creation hook
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ withdraw-pool/      # Pool withdrawal hook
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deposit-pool/       # Pool deposit hook
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- pnpm
- A Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bleu/cow-hooks-dapps
cd cow-hooks-dapps

# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

### Running a Hook Locally

1. Navigate to the specific hook app:

```bash
cd apps/<hook-app-name>
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

3. Connect your hook to CoW Swap:

   - Visit [dev.swap.cow.fi](https://dev.swap.cow.fi/#/100/swap/hooks)
   - Connect your wallet to a supported network
   - Click "Add Pre-Hook Action" or "Add Post-Hook Action"
   - Select "My Custom Hooks"
   - Click "Add custom hook"
   - Enter `http://127.0.0.1:3000` as the hook URL
   - Click "Add"

4. Your hook is now ready to use in the swap interface!

## üîß Development

### Linting

```bash
pnpm check
```

### Building

```bash
pnpm build
```

## üõ† Creating Your Own Hook dApp

Want to create your own hook? Follow these steps to add a new hook dApp to the monorepo:

1. Create a new project in the apps directory:

```bash
bashCopycd apps
mkdir my-custom-hook
cd my-custom-hook
```

2. Copy the basic package.json structure from one of the existing apps, making sure to update:

```json
{
  "name": "@cow-hooks-dapps/my-custom-hook",
  "description": "Your hook description",
  "version": "0.1.0"
  // ... rest of the configuration
}
```

3. Feel free to reuse any components from the packages workspace - that's what it's there for! The shared components can save you time and ensure consistency across hooks.
4. Implement your hook logic following the existing patterns in other apps (remember providing a manifest.json in the app public folder with the hook informations).
5. Deploy your hook:

- You can deploy to any platform of your choice (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, etc.)
- Make sure your deployment URL is HTTPS-enabled
- Test your deployed hook by adding it to CoW Swap using the deployed URL

Remember to:

- Keep your hook focused on a single, clear purpose
- Maintain good error handling and user feedback
- Test thoroughly with different token combinations
- Document any special requirements or configurations
